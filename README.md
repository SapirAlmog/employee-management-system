# employee-management-system

In this project i created an employee management system that can tract employee attendance and keep employees database.
I'm aware that the easyest way to do it is with sql quarries using database, but i wanted to improve my skills handeling csv files with python.
At this point the system can do the foloowing operations:
-The employee can log his attendance manually
-The manager can creat an individual attendance report for each employee.
-The manager can creat a monthly attendance report for all active employees.
-The manager can check for employees who were late.
-The manager can add manually a new employee to the employees database.
-The manager can add new employees from a csv file.
-The manager can delete manually an employee from the employees database.
-The manager can delete employees from a csv file.

My next steps will be:
-Create a UI using django web framework and deploy it to a public server using one of the providers like AWS.
-Creat a databse and add a table of productions per employee for data analysis such as compare work hours versus production per day that determines which employee has the best preformance.

The system goal is to predict which employee has the best preformance.
